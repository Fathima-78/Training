Give me some idea on what is a Data type. What are Primitive Data types and Non-Primitive Data types. Explain with some examples.
A.Definition:A datatype is used to define what type of data used in the variable.
There are two types of datatype.They are:
1.Primitive Datatypes
2.Non-Primitive Datatypes
Both datatype have their own usage in javascript
1.primitive Datatypes:
-->Primitive Datatypes are immutable,which means they cant be changed ones assigned
-->These store single values to the declared variable
There are few datatypes present in the Primitive Datatypes.some of them are:
1.String.
strings are sequence of characters stored in double quotes(" "),single quotes(' ') or template literables(` `).
Before this here typeof() function is used to define the datatype
ex:
let str1="Double quotes"
console.log(str1,typeof(str1));

let str2='single quotes'
console.log(str2,typeof(str2))

let str3='single quotes'
console.log(str2,typeof(str2))
2.Boolean.
Boolean returns the True or false (for decision making like if loops and many more )
ex:
const bool1=true;
console.log(bool1,typeof(bool1))

const bool2=false
console.log(bool2,typeof(bool2))
3.Number.
Number is a datatype which consists of int,float,decimal,exponential etc
ex:
let num1=10;
console.log(num1,typeof(num1))

let num2=12.890
console.log(num2,typeof(num2))

let num3=10e5
console.log(num3,typeof(num3))
4.Undefined.
Undefined datatype is used at the time when a variable is declared but not initialised.
ex:
let a;
console.log(a,typeof(a))
5.Null.
Null is basically absence of an object or an empty space.The return type of null is 'object'.
ex:
let x=null
console.log(x,typeof(x))
6.Bigint.
Any value exceed the range of number datatypes type we consider that as bigint.
-->any value sufix with "n" will be bigint.


let x=(a,b)=>{return a+b;console.log(x)}
x(1,2)
